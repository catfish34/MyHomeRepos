    RFC 2616, “Hypertext Transfer Protocol—HTTP/1.1

http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2068.txt
    RFC 2068 is the 1997 version of the HTTP/1.1 protocol


Any HTTP client, server, or proxy can close a TCP transport connection at any time. The connections normally are closed at the end of a message,[18] but during error conditions, the connection may be closed in the middle of a header line or in other strange places.
This situation is common with pipelined persistent connections. HTTP applications are free to close persistent connections after any period of time. For example, after a persistent connection has been idle for a while, a server may decide to shut it down.
