- Group variables are variables that are applied to groups of servers 
- They are stored in a directory called group_vars/all:
			---
			httpd_port: 80
			ntpserver: 192.168.1.2
- Example of group_vars/dbservers which applies to the hosts in the dbservers group:
			---
			mysqlservice: mysqld
			mysql_port: 3306
			dbuser: root
			dbname: foodb
			upassword: usersecret
You can use them in playbooks, like:
			- name: Create Application DB User
			  mysql_user: name={{ dbuser }} password={{ upassword }}
						  priv=*.*:ALL host='%' state=present

This is testing to see if the inventory name of the machine we’re currently operating on (inventory_hostname) exists in the inventory group dbservers. 
If so, that machine will get an iptables ACCEPT line for port 3306.						  
			{% if inventory_hostname in groups['dbservers'] %}
			-A INPUT -p tcp  --dport 3306 -j  ACCEPT
			{% endif %}

This loops over all of the hosts in the group called monitoring, and adds an ACCEPT line for each monitoring hosts’ default IPV4 address 
to the current machine’s iptables configuration, so that Nagios can monitor those hosts.
			{% for host in groups['monitoring'] %}
			-A INPUT -p tcp -s {{ hostvars[host].ansible_default_ipv4.address }} --dport 5666 -j ACCEPT
			{% endfor %}
