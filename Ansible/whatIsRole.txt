Roles are a way to organize content: tasks, handlers, templates, and files, into reusable components. 
You can say “these hosts are dbservers” or “these hosts are webservers”.
Roles are great and you should use them every time you write playbooks.

site.yml
webservers.yml
fooservers.yml
roles/
   common/
     files/
     templates/
     tasks/
     handlers/
     vars/
     meta/
   webservers/
     files/
     templates/
     tasks/
     handlers/
     vars/
     meta/

In a playbook, it would look like this:
---
- hosts: webservers
  roles:
     - common
     - webservers

If you want to define certain tasks to happen before AND after roles are applied, you can do this:
---
- hosts: webservers

  pre_tasks:
    - shell: echo 'hello'

  roles:
    - { role: some_role }

  tasks:
    - shell: echo 'still busy'

  post_tasks:
    - shell: echo 'goodbye'
