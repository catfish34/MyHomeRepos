Kickstart file is a simple text file, containing a list of items, each identified by a keyword. 
You can create it by using the Kickstart Configurator application or by writing it from scratch.
Using kickstart, a system administrator can create a single file containing the answers to all the questions that 
would normally be asked during a typical installation.
