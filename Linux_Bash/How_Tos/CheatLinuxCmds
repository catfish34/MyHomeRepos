Path													What is
/etc/filesystems										file systems that kernel currently supports
/proc/filesystems										list the file system formats the kernel currently supports									
/etc/fstab												are used when mounting the file system during startup, it does not contain information on the actual current mounts.
/etc/mtab, /proc/mounts (kernel keeps)					file lists the file systems currently mounted and their mountpoints
/boot/													This partition should be located at the start of the disk and should be at least 20 MB or 1 cylinder
/opt/													create a separate partition for /opt/ (4 GB or more) 
/usr/													is usually the biggest directory in the Linux installation
/var/													put on a separate partition
/srv/													When the machine acts as a web or ftp server, the data offered to users could be put on a separate partition
/home/													Putting /home/ on a separate partition prevents users from using up all disk space
/proc/													info on a running system, stored in the kernel memory space
		/proc/cpuinfo									kernel memory, info about CPU
		/proc/devices									View the devices used on your Linux system

/etc/sysconfig/network/routes							all routes are saved in config file
/etc/init.d/											for each diemon script is here
/usr/sbin/ or /sbin										For many scripts, there is a symbolic link. If a link exists, you can start  rcservice start\stop\reload:
	httpd - The daemon of the Apache2 web server
	sshd - secure shell
	syslog-ng	- Logs system messages in the directory /var/log/
/etc/sysconfig/cron 									variables for the configuration of some scripts started by cron
/etc/crontab											system jobs (you cannot remove lines added dduring installation)
/etc/cron.hourly,cron.daily,cron.weekly,cron.monthly	jobs aru running on * basis
/var/spool/cron/lastrun/								last time the jobs were run
/root/bin/cron.daily.local 								it is advisable to write your own additions and modifications to
/etc/cron.d/											Other files for system jobs
/var/spool/cron/tabs/									The jobs of individual users
		Field 					Range
		Minutes 				0–59
		Hours 					0–23
		Day of the Month 		1–31
		Month 					0–12
		Weekday 				0–7
/etc/at.allow 											(users entered here can define jobs)
/etc/at.deny											(users who are not listed in this file can define jobs)
/var/log/boot.messages 									kernel boot messages 
/var/log/ 												track system-level events
/etc/sysconfig/syslog (general parameters),/etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf (actually used by syslog-ng)	
Facility: authpriv,cron,daemon,kern,lpr,mail,news,syslog,user,uucp,local0 – local7
Priority: debug,info,notice,warning,err,crit,alert,emerg
/etc/inittab											current runlevel
/etc/yum.repos.d/										several repo files
/etc/yum.config 										config file for yum (YellowDog Updater Modifier)
/etc/apt/sources.lists 									Debian repos
/etc/apt/sources.list.d 								add more sources in this directory
 /etc/apt/apt.config 									config for debian apt
 /etc/dpkg/dpkg.cfg 									another debian tool that can install, remove package
 /etc/ssh/sshd_config									ssh daemon config file (/etc/init.d/sshd reload, then ssh-keygen to generate key pair, copy public key to a server ssh-copy-id -i)
 /root/.bash_profile									update PATH permanently, source /root/.bash_profile
/etc/sysconfig/iptables									file of brandmayer
