A FOREIGN KEY in one table points to a PRIMARY KEY in another table.
The FOREIGN KEY constraint is used to prevent actions that would destroy links between tables.
The FOREIGN KEY constraint also prevents invalid data from being inserted into the foreign key column, 
because it has to be one of the values contained in the table it points to.

There are three possible values for the "Key" attribute:
1.PRI
2.UNI
3.MUL
The meaning of PRI and UNI are quite clear:
PRI=> primary key
UNI=> unique key
MUL => The name comes from "multiple" because multiple occurences of the same value are allowed.
"If Key is MUL, the column is the first column of a nonunique index in which multiple occurrences of a 
given value are permitted within the column."

First find out table definition:
	mysql> show create table;

will return something like:
******
 PRIMARY KEY (`hostid`),
  KEY `hosts_1` (`host`),
  KEY `hosts_2` (`status`),
  KEY `hosts_3` (`proxy_hostid`),
  KEY `hosts_4` (`name`),
  KEY `hosts_5` (`maintenanceid`),
  KEY `c_hosts_3` (`templateid`),
  CONSTRAINT `c_hosts_1` FOREIGN KEY (`proxy_hostid`) REFERENCES `hosts` (`hostid`),
  CONSTRAINT `c_hosts_2` FOREIGN KEY (`maintenanceid`) REFERENCES `maintenances` (`maintenanceid`),
  CONSTRAINT `c_hosts_3` FOREIGN KEY (`templateid`) REFERENCES `hosts` (`hostid`) ON DELETE CASCADE
) 
******
Use one of these queries to get foreign key names -
mysql>SELECT * FROM  information_schema.KEY_COLUMN_USAGE 
WHERE constraint_schema = <'db_name'> AND table_name = <'table_name'> AND referenced_table_name IS NOT NULL;

DROP FOREIGN KEY:
mysql> ALTER TABLE Orders DROP FOREIGN KEY fk_PerOrders;
