
To verify the signature for a specific package, you first need to obtain a copy of our public GPG  (GNU Privacy Guard) build key

1) find publi key mysql-build@oss.oracle.com in public key server http://pgp.mit.edu/
2) copy - past key to mysql_pubkey.asc
3) import the key into your RPM configuration to validate RPM install packages : rpm --import mysql_pubkey.asc
(http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/checking-gpg-signature.html)

You can also enable and disable sub-repositories by editing manually the /etc/yum.repos.d/
mysql-community.repo file. This is a typical entry for a sub-repository in the file:
# Enable to use MySQL 5.6
[mysql56-community]
name=MySQL 5.6 Community Server
baseurl=//repo.mysql.com/yum/mysql-5.6-community/el/5/$basearch/
enabled=1
gpgcheck=1
#gpgkey=file:/etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-mysql


yum repolist enabled | grep "mysql.*-community.*"
/etc/my.cnf				Config MySQL server
/usr/bin/mysqladmin		mysql admin GUI

chkconfig mysqld on
service mysqld start \ reload \ status \ restart




yum list installed mysql\*
yum --disablerepo=\* provides mysql\*


netstat -tulpn | grep :3306
(l - listening, p - show name and PID of the program, n -show numeric address)

vi /etc/sysconfig/iptables
Note however, that it might be that there is no my.cnf file at any of these locations. So, you can create the file on your own - use one of the sample config files provided with MySQL distribution (on Linux - see /usr/share/mysql/*.cnf files and use whichever is appropriate for you - copy it to /etc/my.cnf and then modify as needed). Also, note that there is also a command line option --defaults-file which may define custom path to my.cnf or my.ini file. For example, this is the case for MySQL 5.5 on Windows - it points to a my.ini file in the data directory, which is not normally listed with mysqld --help --verbose
/usr/share/mysql/my-default.cnf  
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/option-files.html

If the command fails immediately and prints mysqld ended, look for information in the error log (which
by default is the host_name.err file in the data directory).
