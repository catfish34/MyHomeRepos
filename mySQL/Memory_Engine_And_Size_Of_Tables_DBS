The MEMORY storage engine (formerly known as HEAP) creates special-purpose tables with contents that are stored in memory.
There are implicit MEMORY tables which are allocated for query execution, which size can be 
controlled by tmp_table_size and which also only exist for duration of query execution so it is usually easy to catch them. 
There are also explicit MEMORY tables you can create both as permanent and temporary. 
There is a max_heap_table_size variable which allows you to limit size of MEMORY tables (the limit applies both to implicit 
and explicit ones) but as there is no control of how many tables application can create it does not 
really allows to restrict memory usage

The maximum size of MEMORY tables is limited by the max_heap_table_size system variable, which has a default value of 16MB. 
To enforce different size limits for MEMORY tables, change the value of this variable. 
The value in effect for CREATE TABLE, or a subsequent ALTER TABLE or TRUNCATE TABLE, is the value used for the life of the
 table. A server restart also sets the maximum size of existing MEMORY tables to the global max_heap_table_size value. 
You can set the size for individual tables as described later in this section.



mysql> select sum(data_length+index_length) from information_schema.tables where engine='memory';

You can use this query to show the size of a table:
SELECT table_name AS "Table", 
round(((data_length + index_length) / 1024 / 1024), 2) "Size in MB" 
FROM information_schema.TABLES 
WHERE table_schema = "$DB_NAME"
 AND table_name = "$TABLE_NAME";

or this query to list the size of every table in the database, largest first:
SELECT table_name AS "Tables", 
round(((data_length + index_length) / 1024 / 1024), 2) "Size in MB" 
FROM information_schema.TABLES 
WHERE table_schema = "$DB_NAME"
ORDER BY (data_length + index_length) DESC;

Additional You can get size of the mysql databases as following.
SELECT table_schema "DB Name", 
Round(Sum(data_length + index_length) / 1024 / 1024, 1) "DB Size in MB" 
FROM   information_schema.tables 
GROUP  BY table_schema;
