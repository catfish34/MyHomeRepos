Cleaning up A Git Repository After Failed Push With Large File
April 22, 2014 in Github, Software Engineering
Github has a limit of 100MB for file size. Sometimes a repository becomes corrupted when trying to push a commit with a large file;

$ git push
remote: error: GH001: Large files detected.
remote: error: Trace: fd45c3e505c78ed10ce42d3a744d10b1
remote: error: See http://git.io/iEPt8g for more information.
remote: error: File BADFILENAME is XXX MB; this exceeds GitHub's file size limit of 100 MB

This command sometimes works;
$ git filter-branch -f --index-filter 'git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch BADFILENAME'
Rewrite 3cbfef945f119d34f9244f1281238439883d0254 (15/15)rm 'BADFILENAME'
