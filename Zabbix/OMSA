Seems that almost all servers did not start the OMSA on boot - that was definitely a problem since that is the service responsible for detecting errors and report them via SNMP.
 
I have run the following on all physical Dell nodes:
 
/opt/dell/srvadmin/sbin/srvadmin-services.sh restart; omreport system alertlog; /opt/dell/srvadmin/sbin/srvadmin-services.sh enable
