Checks if server is accessible by ICMP ping.

Servers were configured with ansible:
ansible Hetzner -m shell -a "chown root:zabbix /usr/sbin/fping; chmod 4710 /usr/sbin/fping"
ansible Hetzner -m yum -a "name=fping state=latest" 

Zabbix Server was configured:
icmpping[,3] - if at least one packet of the four is returned, the item will return 1.
